# Assignment 2: Transformer Summarizer

Welcome to the second assignment of course 4. In this assignment you will explore summarization using the transformer model. Yes, you will implement the transformer decoder from scratch, but we will slowly walk you through it. There are many hints in this notebook so feel free to use them as needed.

### Introduction

Summarization is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful for a consumer enterprise. For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then you can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks. Anyways who wants to read an article or a long email today, when you can build a transformer to summarize text for you. Let's get started, by completing this assignment you will learn to:  

- Use built-in functions to preprocess your data
- Implement DotProductAttention
- Implement Causal Attention
- Understand how attention works
- Build the transformer model
- Evaluate your model
- Summarize an article

As you can tell, this model is slightly different than the ones you have already implemented. This is heavily based on attention and does not rely on sequences, which allows for parallel computing. 


```python
import sys
import os

import numpy as np

import textwrap
wrapper = textwrap.TextWrapper(width=70)

import trax
from trax import layers as tl
from trax.fastmath import numpy as jnp

# to print the entire np array
np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)
```

## Part 1: Importing the dataset

Trax makes it easy to work with Tensorflow's datasets:


```python
# This will download the dataset if no data_dir is specified.
# Downloading and processing can take bit of time,
# so we have the data already in 'data/' for you

# Importing CNN/DailyMail articles dataset
train_stream_fn = trax.data.TFDS('cnn_dailymail',
                                 data_dir='data/',
                                 keys=('article', 'highlights'),
                                 train=True)

# This should be much faster as the data is downloaded already.
eval_stream_fn = trax.data.TFDS('cnn_dailymail',
                                data_dir='data/',
                                keys=('article', 'highlights'),
                                train=False)
```

## 1.1 Tokenize & Detokenize helper functions

Just like in the previous assignment, the cell above loads in the encoder for you. Given any data set, you have to be able to map words to their indices, and indices to their words. The inputs and outputs to your [Trax](https://github.com/google/trax) models are usually tensors of numbers where each number corresponds to a word. If you were to process your data manually, you would have to make use of the following: 

- <span style='color:blue'> word2Ind: </span> a dictionary mapping the word to its index.
- <span style='color:blue'> ind2Word:</span> a dictionary mapping the index to its word.
- <span style='color:blue'> word2Count:</span> a dictionary mapping the word to the number of times it appears. 
- <span style='color:blue'> num_words:</span> total number of words that have appeared. 

Since you have already implemented these in previous assignments of the specialization, we will provide you with helper functions that will do this for you. Run the cell below to get the following functions:

- <span style='color:blue'> tokenize: </span> converts a text sentence to its corresponding token list (i.e. list of indices). Also converts words to subwords.
- <span style='color:blue'> detokenize: </span> converts a token list to its corresponding sentence (i.e. string).


```python
def tokenize(input_str, EOS=1):
    """Input str to features dict, ready for inference"""
  
    # Use the trax.data.tokenize method. It takes streams and returns streams,
    # we get around it by making a 1-element stream with `iter`.
    inputs =  next(trax.data.tokenize(iter([input_str]),
                                      vocab_dir='vocab_dir/',
                                      vocab_file='summarize32k.subword.subwords'))
    
    # Mark the end of the sentence with EOS
    return list(inputs) + [EOS]

def detokenize(integers):
    """List of ints to str"""
  
    s = trax.data.detokenize(integers,
                             vocab_dir='vocab_dir/',
                             vocab_file='summarize32k.subword.subwords')
    
    return wrapper.fill(s)
```

## 1.2 Preprocessing for Language Models: Concatenate It!

This week you will use a language model -- Transformer Decoder -- to solve
an input-output problem. As you know, language models only predict the next
word, they have no notion of inputs. To create a single input suitable for
a language model, we concatenate inputs with targets putting a separator
in between. We also need to create a mask -- with 0s at inputs and 1s at targets -- so that the model is not penalized for mis-predicting the article and only focuses on the summary. See the preprocess function below for how this is done.


```python
# Special tokens
SEP = 0 # Padding or separator token
EOS = 1 # End of sentence token

# Concatenate tokenized inputs and targets using 0 as separator.
def preprocess(stream):
    for (article, summary) in stream:
        joint = np.array(list(article) + [EOS, SEP] + list(summary) + [EOS])
        mask = [0] * (len(list(article)) + 2) + [1] * (len(list(summary)) + 1) # Accounting for EOS and SEP
        yield joint, joint, np.array(mask)

# You can combine a few data preprocessing steps into a pipeline like this.
input_pipeline = trax.data.Serial(
    # Tokenizes
    trax.data.Tokenize(vocab_dir='vocab_dir/',
                       vocab_file='summarize32k.subword.subwords'),
    # Uses function defined above
    preprocess,
    # Filters out examples longer than 2048
    trax.data.FilterByLength(2048)
)

# Apply preprocessing to data streams.
train_stream = input_pipeline(train_stream_fn())
eval_stream = input_pipeline(eval_stream_fn())

train_input, train_target, train_mask = next(train_stream)

assert sum((train_input - train_target)**2) == 0  # They are the same in Language Model (LM).
```


```python
# prints mask, 0s on article, 1s on summary
print(f'Single example mask:\n\n {train_mask}')
```

## 1.3 Batching with bucketing

As in the previous week, we use bucketing to create batches of data.


```python
# Bucketing to create batched generators.

# Buckets are defined in terms of boundaries and batch sizes.
# Batch_sizes[i] determines the batch size for items with length < boundaries[i]
# So below, we'll take a batch of 16 sentences of length < 128 , 8 of length < 256,
# 4 of length < 512. And so on. 
boundaries =  [128, 256,  512, 1024]
batch_sizes = [16,    8,    4,    2, 1]

# Create the streams.
train_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(
    boundaries, batch_sizes)(train_stream)

eval_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(
    boundaries, batch_sizes)(eval_stream)
```


```python
# Every execution will result in generation of a different article
# Try running this cell multiple times to see how the length of the examples affects the batch size
input_batch, _, mask_batch = next(train_batch_stream)

# Shape of the input_batch
input_batch.shape
```




    (2, 1024)




```python
# print corresponding integer values
print(input_batch[0])
```

    Article:
    
     By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:53 EST, 12 January 2012 . A
    motorist was stunned when he discovered double yellow lines had been
    painted underneath his car while it was parked - and then given a
    ticket. Flecks of yellow paint were even sprayed on the bumper of
    Patrick McCrystal's car as the lines were painted under the front of
    it in Kedleston Street, Derby. The 49-year-old had parked his Ford
    Fiesta in the street near to a Co-operative store and a petrol
    station, where he works, for three years. Stunned: Patrick McCrystal
    with his Ford Fiesta, which was given a ticket after council workmen
    had sprayed yellow lines under the car while it was parked legally .
    When he parked for his 2pm shift, he noticed new yellow lines had been
    painted across a housing block entrance. But there was a gap between
    those lines and existing ones in the street, so Mr McCrystal parked
    there, in his usual spot. Hours later, a colleague on his dinner break
    saw that extra lines had been painted below the front of Mr
    McCrystal's car. And, when he went out, Mr McCrystal discovered he had
    been given a parking ticket. Tell-tale sign: The workmen left flecks
    of paint on the bumper of the car as they sprayed underneath . He
    said: 'There is even paint on my front bumper where they've caught it
    reaching under to paint the lines. 'There were no lines there when I
    parked. I can't believe they've done it.' The new lines extended from
    existing double yellow lines which had previously ended about two feet
    from Mr McCrystal's front bumper. Apology: The ticket left on Mr
    McCrystal's window. Derby City Council blamed a breakdown in
    communication and has now revoked the £70 fine . Now a Derby City
    Council official has said the £70 fine had been issued in error and
    would be revoked. Mr McCrystal, from Derby, said notices had been put
    up several weeks ago saying parking restrictions would be introduced
    but they did not say when. He said: 'If they were going to paint
    yellow lines then they should have put up cones to stop people
    parking. 'When I pulled up, I saw the gap between the old lines and
    the new ones and thought it was okay to park there. Nothing gave me
    the impression I couldn't.' A passer-by said council staff had been
    angered they could not paint the lines because of the parked car.
    David Gartside, head of traffic and transport at the authority, said:

# Part 2: Summarization with transformer

Now that we have given you the data generator and have handled the preprocessing for you, it is time for you to build your own model. We saved you some time because we know you have already preprocessed data before in this specialization, so we would rather you spend your time doing the next steps. 

You will be implementing the attention from scratch and then using it in your transformer model. Concretely, you will understand how attention works, how you use it to connect the encoder and the decoder.

<img src="transformer_decoder_zoomin.png">

<a name='2.1'></a>
## 2.1 Dot product attention 

Now you will implement dot product attention which takes in a query, key, value, and a mask. It returns the output. 

<img src ="dotproduct.png">


Here are some helper functions that will help you create tensors and display useful information:
   - `create_tensor`  creates a `jax numpy array` from a list of lists.
   - `display_tensor` prints out the shape and the actual tensor.


```python
def create_tensor(t):
    """Create tensor from list of lists"""
    return jnp.array(t)


def display_tensor(t, name):
    """Display shape and tensor"""
    print(f'{name} shape: {t.shape}\n')
    print(f'{t}\n')
```

Before implementing it yourself, you can play around with a toy example of `dot product attention` without the softmax  operation. Technically it would not be `dot product attention` without the softmax but this is done to avoid giving away too much of the answer and the idea is to display these tensors to give you a sense of how they look like.

The formula for attention is this one:

$$
\text { Attention }(Q, K, V)=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}+{M}\right) V\tag{1}\
$$

$d_{k}$ stands for the dimension of queries and keys.

The `query`, `key`, `value` and `mask` vectors are provided for this example.

Notice that the masking is done using very negative values that will yield a similar effect to using $-\infty $. 


```python
q = create_tensor([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])
display_tensor(q, 'query')
k = create_tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
display_tensor(k, 'key')
v = create_tensor([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]])
display_tensor(v, 'value')
m = create_tensor([[0, 0], [-1e9, 0]])
display_tensor(m, 'mask')
```

    query shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[1 0 0]
     [0 1 0]]
    
    key shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[1 2 3]
     [4 5 6]]
    
    value shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[0 1 0]
     [1 0 1]]
    
    mask shape: (2, 2)
    
    [[ 0.e+00  0.e+00]
     [-1.e+09  0.e+00]]
    


**Expected Output:**
```CPP
query shape: (2, 3)

[[1 0 0]
 [0 1 0]]

key shape: (2, 3)

[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]

value shape: (2, 3)

[[0 1 0]
 [1 0 1]]

mask shape: (2, 2)

[[ 0.e+00  0.e+00]
 [-1.e+09  0.e+00]]

```


```python
q_dot_k = q @ k.T / jnp.sqrt(3)
display_tensor(q_dot_k, 'query dot key')
```

    query dot key shape: (2, 2)
    
    [[0.57735026 2.309401  ]
     [1.1547005  2.8867514 ]]
    


**Expected Output:**
```CPP
query dot key shape: (2, 2)

[[0.57735026 2.309401  ]
 [1.1547005  2.8867514 ]]
```


```python
masked = q_dot_k + m
display_tensor(masked, 'masked query dot key')
```

    masked query dot key shape: (2, 2)
    
    [[ 5.7735026e-01  2.3094010e+00]
     [-1.0000000e+09  2.8867514e+00]]
    


**Expected Output:**
```CPP
masked query dot key shape: (2, 2)

[[ 5.7735026e-01  2.3094010e+00]
 [-1.0000000e+09  2.8867514e+00]]
```


```python
display_tensor(masked @ v, 'masked query dot key dot value')
```

    masked query dot key dot value shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[ 2.3094010e+00  5.7735026e-01  2.3094010e+00]
     [ 2.8867514e+00 -1.0000000e+09  2.8867514e+00]]
    


**Expected Output:**
```CPP
masked query dot key dot value shape: (2, 3)

[[ 2.3094010e+00  5.7735026e-01  2.3094010e+00]
 [ 2.8867514e+00 -1.0000000e+09  2.8867514e+00]]
```

In order to use the previous dummy tensors to test some of the graded functions, a batch dimension should be added to them so they mimic the shape of real-life examples. The mask is also replaced by a version of it that resembles the one that is used by trax:


```python
q_with_batch = q[None,:]
display_tensor(q_with_batch, 'query with batch dim')
k_with_batch = k[None,:]
display_tensor(k_with_batch, 'key with batch dim')
v_with_batch = v[None,:]
display_tensor(v_with_batch, 'value with batch dim')
m_bool = create_tensor([[True, True], [False, True]])
display_tensor(m_bool, 'boolean mask')
```

    query with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)
    
    [[[1 0 0]
      [0 1 0]]]
    
    key with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)
    
    [[[1 2 3]
      [4 5 6]]]
    
    value with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)
    
    [[[0 1 0]
      [1 0 1]]]
    
    boolean mask shape: (2, 2)
    
    [[ True  True]
     [False  True]]
    


**Expected Output:**
```CPP
query with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)

[[[1 0 0]
  [0 1 0]]]

key with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)

[[[1 2 3]
  [4 5 6]]]

value with batch dim shape: (1, 2, 3)

[[[0 1 0]
  [1 0 1]]]

boolean mask shape: (2, 2)

[[ True  True]
 [False  True]]
```

### Exercise 01

**Instructions:** Implement the dot product attention. Concretely, implement the following equation


$$
\text { Attention }(Q, K, V)=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{Q K^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}+{M}\right) V\tag{1}\
$$

$Q$ - query, 
$K$ - key, 
$V$ - values, 
$M$ - mask, 
${d_k}$ - depth/dimension of the queries and keys (used for scaling down)

You can implement this formula either by `trax` numpy (trax.math.numpy) or regular `numpy` but it is recommended to use `jnp`.

Something to take into consideration is that within trax, the masks are tensors of `True/False` values not 0's and $-\infty$ as in the previous example. Within the graded function don't think of applying the mask by summing up matrices, instead use `jnp.where()` and treat the **mask as a tensor of boolean values with `False` for values that need to be masked and True for the ones that don't.**

Also take into account that the real tensors are far more complex than the toy ones you just played with. Because of this avoid using shortened operations such as `@` for dot product or `.T` for transposing. Use `jnp.matmul()` and `jnp.swapaxes()` instead.

This is the self-attention block for the transformer decoder. Good luck!  


```python
# UNQ_C1
# GRADED FUNCTION: DotProductAttention
def DotProductAttention(query, key, value, mask):
    """Dot product self-attention.

        value (jax.interpreters.xla.DeviceArray): array of value representations with shape (L_k by d) where L_v = L_k

    Returns:

    assert query.shape[-1] == key.shape[-1] == value.shape[-1], "Embedding dimensions of q, k, v aren't all the same"

    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' with your code) ###
    # Save depth/dimension of the query embedding for scaling down the dot product
    depth = query.shape[-1] 

    # Calculate scaled query key dot product according to formula above
    dots = jnp.matmul(query, jnp.swapaxes(key, -1, -2)) / jnp.sqrt(depth)

    # Apply the mask
    if mask is not None: # The 'None' in this line does not need to be replaced
        dots = jnp.where(mask, dots, jnp.full_like(dots, -1e9))
    
    # Softmax formula implementation
    # Use trax.fastmath.logsumexp of dots to avoid underflow by division by large numbers

    logsumexp = trax.fastmath.logsumexp(dots, axis=-1, keepdims=True)

    # Take exponential of dots minus logsumexp to get softmax
    # Use jnp.exp()
    dots = jnp.exp(dots - logsumexp)

    # Multiply dots by value to get self-attention

## 2.2 Causal Attention

Now you are going to implement causal attention: multi-headed attention with a mask to attend only to words that occurred before. 

<img src = "causal.png">

In the image above, a word can see everything that is before it, but not what is after it. To implement causal attention, you will have to transform vectors and do many reshapes. You will need to implement the functions below.


<a name='ex02'></a>
### Exercise 02

Implement the following functions that will be needed for Causal Attention:

- <span style='color:blue'> compute_attention_heads </span>: Gets an input $x$ of dimension (batch_size, seqlen, n_heads $\times$ d_head) and splits the last (depth) dimension and stacks it to the zeroth dimension to allow matrix multiplication (batch_size $\times$ n_heads, seqlen, d_head).
- <span style='color:blue'> dot_product_self_attention </span>: Creates a mask matrix with `False` values above the diagonal and `True` values below and calls DotProductAttention which implements dot product self attention.
- <span style='color:blue'> compute_attention_output </span>: Undoes compute_attention_heads by splitting first (vertical) dimension and stacking in the last (depth) dimension (batch_size, seqlen, n_heads $\times$ d_head). These operations concatenate (stack/merge) the heads. 

Next there are some toy tensors which may serve to give you an idea of the data shapes and opperations involved in Causal Attention. They are also useful to test out your functions! 


```python
tensor2d = create_tensor(q)
display_tensor(tensor2d, 'query matrix (2D tensor)')

tensor4d2b = create_tensor([[q, q], [q, q]])
display_tensor(tensor4d2b, 'batch of two (multi-head) collections of query matrices (4D tensor)')

tensor3dc = create_tensor([jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1)])
display_tensor(tensor3dc, 'one batch of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor)')

tensor3dc3b = create_tensor([jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1), jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1), jnp.concatenate([q, q], axis = -1)])
display_tensor(tensor3dc3b, 'three batches of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor)')
```

    query matrix (2D tensor) shape: (2, 3)
    
    [[1 0 0]
     [0 1 0]]
    
    batch of two (multi-head) collections of query matrices (4D tensor) shape: (2, 2, 2, 3)
    
    [[[[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]
    
      [[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]]
    
    
     [[[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]
    
      [[1 0 0]
       [0 1 0]]]]
    
    one batch of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor) shape: (1, 2, 6)
    
    [[[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]]
    
    three batches of concatenated heads of query matrices (3d tensor) shape: (3, 2, 6)
    
    [[[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]
    
     [[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]
    
     [[1 0 0 1 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0 1 0]]]
    


It is important to know that the following 3 functions would normally be defined within the `CausalAttention` function further below. 

However this makes these functions harder to test. Because of this, these functions are shown individually using a `closure` (when necessary) that simulates them being inside of the `CausalAttention` function. This is done because they rely on some variables that can be accessed from within `CausalAttention`.

### Support Functions

<span style='color:blue'> compute_attention_heads </span>: Gets an input $x$ of dimension (batch_size, seqlen, n_heads $\times$ d_head) and splits the last (depth) dimension and stacks it to the zeroth dimension to allow matrix multiplication (batch_size $\times$ n_heads, seqlen, d_head).

**For the closures you only have to fill the inner function.**

### Causal Attention Function

Now it is time for you to put everything together within the `CausalAttention` or Masked multi-head attention function:

<img src = "masked-attention.png"> 

**Instructions:** Implement the causal attention.
Your model returns the causal attention through a $tl.Serial$ with the following:

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Branch](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Branch) </span>: consisting of 3 [tl.Dense(d_feature), ComputeAttentionHeads] to account for the queries, keys, and values.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Fn](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn)</span>: Takes in dot_product_self_attention function and uses it to compute the dot product using $Q$, $K$, $V$.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Fn](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn)</span>: Takes in compute_attention_output_closure to allow for parallel computing.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dense](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense)</span>: Final Dense layer, with dimension `d_feature`.

Remember that in order for trax to properly handle the functions you just defined, they need to be added as layers using the [`tl.Fn()`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn) function.

## 2.3 Transformer decoder block

Now that you have implemented the causal part of the transformer, you will implement the transformer decoder block. Concretely you will be implementing this image now.

<img src = "transformer_decoder_1.png" style = "height:300px"> 

To implement this function, you will have to call the `CausalAttention` or Masked multi-head attention function you implemented above. You will have to add a feedforward which consists of: 

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.LayerNorm](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.normalization.LayerNorm) </span>: used to layer normalize
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dense](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense) </span>: the dense layer
- <span style='color:blue'> [ff_activation](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.activation_fns.Relu) </span>: feed forward activation (we use ReLu) here.
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dropout](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dropout) </span>: dropout layer
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dense](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense) </span>: dense layer
- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Dropout](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dropout) </span>: dropout layer

Finally once you implement the feedforward, you can go ahead and implement the entire block using: 

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Residual](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual) </span>: takes in the tl.LayerNorm(), causal attention block, tl.dropout. 

- <span style='color:blue'> [tl.Residual](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual) </span>: takes in the feedforward block you will implement.

# Part 3: Training

Now you are going to train your model. As usual, you have to define the cost function, the optimizer, and decide whether you will be training it on a `gpu` or `cpu`. In this case, you will train your model on a cpu for a few steps and we will load in a pre-trained model that you can use to predict with your own words.

<a name='3.1'></a>
### 3.1 Training the model

You will now write a function that takes in your model and trains it. To train your model you have to decide how many times you want to iterate over the entire data set. Each iteration is defined as an `epoch`. For each epoch, you have to go over all the data, using your training iterator.

<a name='ex05'></a>
### Exercise 05
**Instructions:** Implement the `train_model` program below to train the neural network above. Here is a list of things you should do:

- Create the train task by calling [`trax.supervised.training.TrainTask`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.TrainTask) and pass in the following: 
    - <span style='color:blue'> labeled_data </span> = train_gen
    - <span style='color:blue'> loss_fn </span> = [tl.CrossEntropyLoss()](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.metrics.CrossEntropyLoss)
    - <span style='color:blue'> optimizer </span> = [trax.optimizers.Adam(0.01)](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.optimizers.html#trax.optimizers.adam.Adam)
    - <span style='color:blue'> lr_schedule </span> = [lr_schedule](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.lr_schedules.warmup_and_rsqrt_decay)


- Create the eval task by calling [`trax.supervised.training.EvalTask`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.EvalTask) and pass in the following: 
    - <span style='color:blue'> labeled_data </span> = eval_gen
    - <span style='color:blue'> metrics </span> = tl.CrossEntropyLoss() and [tl.Accuracy()](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.metrics.Accuracy)
    
    
- Create the training loop by calling [`trax.supervised.Training.Loop`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.supervised.html#trax.supervised.training.Loop) and pass in the following: 
    - <span style='color:blue'> TransformerLM </span> 
    - <span style='color:blue'> train_task </span> 
    - <span style='color:blue'> eval_task </span> = [eval_task]
    - <span style='color:blue'> output_dir</span> = output_dir
    
You will be using a cross entropy loss, with Adam optimizer. Please read the [Trax](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation to get a full understanding. 

The training loop that this function returns can be runned using the `run()` method by passing in the desired number of steps.


```python
from trax.supervised import training

# UNQ_C8
# GRADED FUNCTION: train_model
def training_loop(TransformerLM, train_gen, eval_gen, output_dir = "~/model"):
    '''
    Input:

        output_dir (str): folder to save your file.
        
    Returns:
        trax.supervised.training.Loop: Training loop.
    '''
    output_dir = os.path.expanduser(output_dir)  # trainer is an object
    lr_schedule = trax.lr.warmup_and_rsqrt_decay(n_warmup_steps=1000, max_value=0.01)

    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' with your code) ###
    train_task = training.TrainTask( 
      labeled_data=train_gen, # The training generator
      loss_layer=tl.CrossEntropyLoss(), # Loss function 
      optimizer=trax.optimizers.Adam(0.01), # Optimizer (Don't forget to set LR to 0.01)
      lr_schedule=lr_schedule,
      n_steps_per_checkpoint=10
    )

    eval_task = training.EvalTask( 
      labeled_data=eval_gen, # The evaluation generator
      metrics=[tl.CrossEntropyLoss(), tl.Accuracy()] # CrossEntropyLoss and Accuracy
    )

    ### END CODE HERE ###

    loop = training.Loop(TransformerLM(d_model=4,
                                       d_ff=16,
                                       n_layers=1,
                                       n_heads=2,
                                       mode='train'),
                         train_task,
                         eval_tasks=[eval_task],
                         output_dir=output_dir)
    
    return loop
```

Notice that the model will be trained for only 10 steps. 

Even with this constraint the model with the original default arguments took a very long time to finish. Because of this some parameters are changed when defining the model that is fed into the training loop in the function above.


```python
# Should take around 1.5 minutes
!rm -f ~/model/model.pkl.gz
loop = training_loop(TransformerLM, train_batch_stream, eval_batch_stream)
loop.run(10)
```

 # Part 4:  Evaluation  

<a name='4.1'></a>
### 4.1 Loading in a trained model

In this part you will evaluate by loading in an almost exact version of the model you coded, but we trained it for you to save you time. Please run the cell below to load in the model.

As you may have already noticed the model that you trained and the pretrained model share the same overall architecture but they have different values for some of the parameters:

    
   `Original (pretrained) model: `                                 
                                       
    TransformerLM(vocab_size=33300, d_model=512, d_ff=2048, n_layers=6, n_heads=8, 
                   dropout=0.1, max_len=4096, ff_activation=tl.Relu)
                   
   `Your model:`
   
    TransformerLM(d_model=4, d_ff=16, n_layers=1, n_heads=2)
   
   **Only the parameters shown for your model were changed. The others stayed the same.**


```python
# Get the model architecture
model = TransformerLM(mode='eval')

# Load the pre-trained weights
model.init_from_file('model.pkl.gz', weights_only=True)
```

<a name='5'></a>
# Part 5: Testing with your own input

You will now test your input. You are going to implement greedy decoding. This consists of two functions. The first one allows you to identify the next symbol. It gets the argmax of the output of your model and then returns that index. 

<a name='ex06'></a>
### Exercise 06
**Instructions:** Implement the next symbol function that takes in the cur_output_tokens and the trained model to return the index of the next word. 


```python
# UNQ_C9
def next_symbol(cur_output_tokens, model):
    """Returns the next symbol for a given sentence.

    Args:
        cur_output_tokens (list): tokenized sentence with EOS and PAD tokens at the end.
        model (trax.layers.combinators.Serial): The transformer model.

    Returns:
        int: tokenized symbol.
    """
    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' with your code) ###
    
    # current output tokens length
    token_length = len(cur_output_tokens)
    # calculate the minimum power of 2 big enough to store token_length
    # HINT: use np.ceil() and np.log2()
    # add 1 to token_length so np.log2() doesn't receive 0 when token_length is 0
    padded_length = 2**int(np.ceil(np.log2(token_length + 1)))

    # Fill cur_output_tokens with 0's until it reaches padded_length
    padded = cur_output_tokens + [0] * (padded_length - token_length)
    padded_with_batch = np.array(padded)[None, :] # Don't replace this 'None'! This is a way of setting the batch dim

    # model expects a tuple containing two padded tensors (with batch)
    output, _ = model((padded_with_batch, padded_with_batch)) 
    # HINT: output has shape (1, padded_length, vocab_size)
    # To get log_probs you need to index output with 0 in the first dim
    # token_length in the second dim and all of the entries for the last dim.
    log_probs = output[0, token_length, :]
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return int(np.argmax(log_probs))
```


```python
# Test it out!
sentence_test_nxt_symbl = "I want to fly in the sky."
detokenize([next_symbol(tokenize(sentence_test_nxt_symbl)+[0], model)])
```




    'The'



**Expected Output:**
```CPP
'The'
```

<a name='5.1'></a>
### 5.1 Greedy decoding

Now you will implement the greedy_decode algorithm that will call the `next_symbol` function. It takes in the input_sentence, the trained model and returns the decoded sentence. 

<a name='ex07'></a>
### Exercise 07

**Instructions**: Implement the greedy_decode algorithm. 


```python
# UNQ_C10
# Decoding functions.
def greedy_decode(input_sentence, model):
    """Greedy decode function.

    Args:
        input_sentence (string): a sentence or article.
        model (trax.layers.combinators.Serial): Transformer model.

    Returns:

    """
    
    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' with your code) ###
    # Use tokenize()
    cur_output_tokens = tokenize(input_sentence) + [0]
    generated_output = [] 
    cur_output = 0 
    EOS = 1 
    
    while cur_output != EOS:
        # Get next symbol
        cur_output = next_symbol(cur_output_tokens, model)
        # Append next symbol to original sentence
        cur_output_tokens.append(cur_output)
        # Append next symbol to generated sentence
        generated_output.append(cur_output)
        print(detokenize(generated_output))
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return detokenize(generated_output)
```


```python
# Test it out on a sentence!
test_sentence = "It was a sunny day when I went to the market to buy some flowers. But I only found roses, not tulips."
print(wrapper.fill(test_sentence), '\n')
print(greedy_decode(test_sentence, model))
```

    It was a sunny day when I went to the market to buy some flowers. But
    I only found roses, not tulips.
